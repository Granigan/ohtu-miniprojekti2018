## Definition of Done

As developers, we agree to follow this definition of Done in our Ohtu Miniproject.

* The user story has been split into tasks, and each of the tasks have been completed and reviewed.

* The project has the user story implemented, and goes through the production pipeline without any errors or issues.

* The functionality described in the user story must be available in the production version of the project.

* Production pipeline includes GitHub, Travis, Codacy, and Heroku.

* The user story has a defined acceptance criteria.

* All acceptance criteria are also worded into Cucumber-based behaviour-driven tests.

* All tests, including behaviour and unit tests, pass.



If even one of these items is not completed, the user story may not be called 'Done'.
