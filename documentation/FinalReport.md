## Background
Team "Is Trello Okay?" was originally formed already before the course began, in the freshman group, though the name was found only after stubborness to stick with Trello as the backlog tool regardless of the warnings. Team also grew to full five members with one more member joining in at the group forming event.

Team members were a varied bunch, few with lots of experience in specific required aspects (e.g. configuration, databases, project management), few with a more general aptitude to working in a team and on a software development project. While the team obviously did take advantage of individual skills to meet the client and course demands, it also emphasised sharing knowledge through pair programming and mentoring.

## Sprint History
After each sprint the team held a Mad, Sad, Glad -retrospect to review the process and find flaws. This worked well, and the team was able to adapt new process features and discard old ones throughout the project. Below are the main issues from each sprint, for further details please see the linked retrospect and client feedback notes. This document only includes the main Mad and Sad topics, glad ones were actually more abundant, but did not require corrections and are not brought up here.

### Sprint #1 - SETUP

The first sprint revolved around selecting a platform and configuration for the project, and choosing the process tracking tools and establishing a working process. The aforementioned prior experience of team members was both a benefit and a disadvantage, as on the one hand the team had a specialist for both tasks and was thus able to settle on tech, pipeline, and process very quickly, but on the other, the forming process was largely handled by an individual instead of a team process. This came up in the retrospect when one of the main issues discussed was too little time spent at the initialisation of the process. This led us to emphasise sharing knowledge further down the project, and spend more time in a face-to-face sprint planning session.

Another clear issue was the task scheduling. The original process required each task to be assigned (albeit tentatively) to someone. However, not enough consideration was put into this, as strict assignments led to conflicts with scheduling and tasks pending on others. The team addressed this issue by spending more time discussing task priorities and everyone's personal schedule during the sprint planning.

Finally, feedback from the client dictated team needed to improve on Trello usage, which led to splitting one board into multiple ones - which in hindsight was a great upgrade.

### Sprint #2 - SORT & CRUD

By sprint two, the team had gotten over the birthing problems and was getting some serious work done. The great flow and feeling was illustrated by the retrospect having no Sad topics, and a single Mad topic (which was a technical issue involving a fringe case in web testing.) The team discussed if such cases could be prevented in the future with help of external checkers, but in the end deemed it unnecessary.

### Sprint #3 - BLOGS & FILTER
[Retrospect](documentation/sprint/3/retrospect.md) & [Feedback](documentation/sprint/3/feedback.md)

Carrying on with the good momentum from the second sprint, team performed well in the third one as well. As a Sad topic, it was noted and discussed that personal life can and does intervene in one's ability to contribute. General consensus was that this is normal and expected, but it is critical to communicate with the team so others know to adjust.
 
On the tech side, a major issue with testing pipeline was identified and discussed: Cucumber tests were built to work one after another, and this was becoming unbearable. Team placed heavy emphasis on figuring out solutions and made it a priority going into the next sprint.

### Sprint #4 - YOUTUBE & BOOTSTRAP - DEMO
After the last sprint and its demo, a brief standing retrospect was held, but team members were mostly just glad about the completion of the project to really be able to come up with any Sad or Mad topics. There also was no more feedback given, aside from the applause for the demo.

## Troubles and Successes
The team faced most issues in the very first sprint. However, the retrospect worked wonders and the issues in scheduling and assignments were quickly overcame. Perhaps the greatest success was the great atmosphere the team achieved throughout the project. While this was to be expected with a pre-formed group, it actually was challenged when the team unexpectantly got a new member at the official team forming event. However, the newcomer integrated quickly to the group, and from then on the team cohesion was excellent.

On the tech side the process got off to a flying start with the quick setup and configuration, which then allowed us to meet every user story agreed with the client.

## What We Learned, What We Wanted to Learn, and Why Did We Learn *That*?
While the team chose most commonly known tech as a starting point, every member got to practice their skills and learn bits and pieces of new technologies. But perhaps more importantly, a lot of soft, and project management skills were picked up during the project. It was even shocking to see how much even a small project and team such as this requires oversight and 'paperwork' to work fluently and efficiently, but at the same when everyone does their part of the management, it doesn't become too cumbersome for anyone.

Trello, after adjustments suggested by the client, turned out to be excellent for a project this size because of it being lightweight, but it was agreed it would not scale well, should the project last much longer, or consist of a bigger team.

## Conclusion
The team worked well together, covering for each other as needed, encountered few difficulties, but overcame them as one, providing a great end result - and learning all through the process.
