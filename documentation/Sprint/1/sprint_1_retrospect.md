## Sprint #1 Retrospect

Using the "Mad, Sad, Glad" approach, the team discussed the first sprint and sought to find improvements for the future ones. In the voting phase, everyone was suspiciously unanimous about the importance of the issues.

### Topics & Discussion
5 votes:
Mad/Sad: **Sprint planning with face-to-face time was too short.** Everyone felt there was not enough time to properly plan the sprint, which lead to misunderstandings and frustration. However, it was also noted that the first sprint is the most confusing one, with people needing to get to know each other, the project needing the configuration, and goals being vague.
**Action points:**
* Wednesday meet: retrospect & sprint planning after client meet is the main face-to-face meeting. (If the need arises, another meeting might be possible.)
* A check-up meeting via Discord, possibly on Monday evening to make sure sprint is on track.

Sad: Task division and task scheduling wasn't properly organised and lead to frustration, time lost, and ultimately to deadline driven development. 
**Action points:**
* Less strict assignments, freedom to change tasking on the fly.
* Consider everyone's working schedule to avoid progress blocked by pending tasks.

Glad: **Tasks were split into very small and detailed tasks, which was great.** These tiny tasks allow for easier starting of work and a small step is always easier than a big one. Let's keep it up.

Glad: **Everyone participated! Woo!** All of the team was actively involved both in Telegram and in the development. Hooray!

#### NO VOTES Categories:
MAD:
**Spring / Cucumber / Selenium documentation**
Configuration hell can be hell. No immediate action to take.

SAD:
**Some felt they couldn't participate as much as they'd like, and missed out on some of the learning experience.** It was noted that the goal is not to learn absolutely everything during the process, and it's great the process progresses also when oneself is not actively working on it. However, it is also unfortunate that some of the knowledge won't get shared as people who are most apt at something, like to do it.
* Let's do more pairwork, especially combining experienced and inexperienced person to do a task should propagate knowledge and maximise learning.
**Trello's not entirely okay**
* We'll split each sprint into its own board to keep it clearer and to preserve sprint history.
**Poor personal communication**
Realisation that TG-chat is (almost) always there, and we're in this as a group. Even if a task is assigned to you, you're not alone with it.

GLAD:
**Sprint #1 went well overall.**
**Quick setup of dev environment and production pipeline, sets us up for a great project.** For future reference, doing configuration etc in pairs will be an amazing learning experience.
