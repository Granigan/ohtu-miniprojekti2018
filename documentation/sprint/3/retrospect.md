## Sprint #3 Retrospect

Verbally done as only few issues arose.

### Glad Topics
* Sprint scheduled and executed well!
* No deadline driven development.

### Sad Topics
* Testing doesn't scale. This was added as a high priority task into the spring backlog.
* Personal life can limit attendance to the project. This is to be expected - everyone's been involved in the project and team covers up when an individual is unavailable.

### Mad Topics
* Validating has multiple definitions! User input and client's needs must be *validated*.
