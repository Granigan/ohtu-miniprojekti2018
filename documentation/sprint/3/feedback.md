## Sprint 3 feedback
*Aki was absent from the meeting as was previously agreed.*

* Comment from client: "toimii kuin elokuvissa" 
* Client tested the server release following the given instructions: success!
* Inputin validation was lackluster and needs improving

Overall, the weekly criteria was met. Meeting included a brief discussion about Trello and whether it scales or not. It doesn't all that well. GitHub projects might be the answer.

In addition to the new user stories, a refactoring demand was made by the client:
Remove course fields from all tips, and add a description text area instead.
